# recipepage-FREECODECAMP.ORG-LAB-
This is my first lab project with freeCodeCamp.org, a recipe list app made entirely of HTML-basics.

I'm Adrian, entering college to get a "Bachelor's In Computer Engineering". I've always been interested in tech as a kid, if we had all the money in the world I'm sure I'd have a gigantic room full of perfectly fine tech that's currently broken because I broke it to fix it. 
As someone who is going to pursue computer engineering, It'd be nice to break into the coding space while it's still summer.
It's not a low-level language, yet, but I was hoping this could be a good place for me to pick up on coding fundamentals.

So far it is, coding is fun. 

In total this project took me 2 hours and 10 minutes. Though, me being scared outta my mind seeing the empty editor and running back to the CatPhotoApp tutorial probably had something to do with it.

Went the extra mile, and added more than the one photo that was required. Learned that I can't even change the font on an HTML website without a CSS subfile.

Making this was very fun, the most focused my "brainrotted" brain has been in a while. I hope it keeps it's magic.
